# device-which-commit.sh — say which commit the app installed on a device was
# built from.
#
# From the app-tooling pattern `git-commit-stamp`
# (https://github.com/tikitu/app-tooling, patterns/git-commit-stamp); the
# project's app-tooling.toml records which release this copy came from.
# Keep project-specific changes out of this file, so that updating it means
# copying it again.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/device-which-commit.sh <device> <bundle-id>
#
# <device> is anything `xcrun devicectl` accepts: a name, UDID or hostname.
#
# A phone reports the installed app's CFBundleVersion and nothing else of its
# Info.plist, so this reads that — `<count>.<dirty>`, as stamp-git-commit.sh
# --bundle-version wrote it — and finds the commit with that count on the
# first-parent history of HEAD. That is the right commit when the build came
# from this branch (or from a branch it has since merged). The exact SHA is
# only in the app's AppGitCommit key, which the app shows itself.
