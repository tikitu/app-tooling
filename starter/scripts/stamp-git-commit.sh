# stamp-git-commit.sh — record in a built app which commit it was built from.
#
# From the app-tooling pattern `git-commit-stamp`
# (https://github.com/tikitu/app-tooling, patterns/git-commit-stamp); the
# project's app-tooling.toml records which release this copy came from.
# Keep project-specific changes out of this file, so that updating it means
# copying it again.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/stamp-git-commit.sh [--bundle-version] <Info.plist>
#
# Sets `AppGitCommit` in the plist to the short SHA of HEAD, with `-dirty`
# appended when the working tree differs from HEAD (tracked changes or
# untracked files that are not ignored, since SwiftPM compiles untracked
# sources too); `no-commits` in a repository with nothing committed yet.
# Outside a git repository, or if git fails, the build fails: a stamp of
# "unknown" would later read as an answer. To build from an export with no
# .git on purpose, set STAMP_ALLOW_NO_GIT=1 and it writes `unknown`.
#
# --bundle-version also sets `CFBundleVersion` to `<count>.<dirty>`: the
# number of commits in HEAD's history, which rises along a branch, then 1 if
# the tree was dirty and 0 if not. It is there because it is the only one of
# the two that can be read back from a phone: `xcrun devicectl device info
# apps` reports CFBundleVersion and not custom keys. The dot is what makes it
# recognisable: a build from before the stamp has a hand-set `1`, which
# would otherwise read as "built from the first commit". App Store Connect
# accepts up to three dot-separated integers, compared part by part.
#
# Called on the *built* plist, never the source one: from an Xcode run-script
# phase with "$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$INFOPLIST_PATH" (so Xcode's Run button gets
# the stamp too), and from build.sh with the assembled bundle's plist. The
# build signs after this, so the stamp is covered by the signature.
